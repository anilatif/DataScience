Zac Efron,Rewrite The Stars,Pop,Pop,Pop,"You know I want you It's not a secret I try to hide I know you want me So don't keep saying our hands are tied You claim it's not in the cards Fate is pulling you miles away And out of reach from me But you're here in my heart So who can stop me if I decide That you're my destiny? What if we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine Nothing could keep us apart You'd be the one I was meant to find It's up to you, and it's up to me No one can say what we get to be So why don't we rewrite the stars? Maybe the world could be ours Tonight You think it's easy You think I don't want to run to you But there are mountains And there are doors that we can't walk through I know you're wondering why Because we're able to be Just you and me Within these walls But when we go outside You're going to wake up and see that it was hopeless after all No one can rewrite the stars How can you say you'll be mine? Everything keeps us apart And I'm not the one you were meant to find It's not up to you It's not up to me When everyone tells us what we can be How can we rewrite the stars? Say that the world can be ours Tonight All I want is to fly with you All I want is to fall with you So just give me all of you It feels impossible (it's not impossible) Is it impossible? Say that it's possible How do we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine? Nothing can keep us apart 'Cause you are the one I was meant to find It's up to you And it's up to me No one can say what we get to be And why don't we rewrite the stars? Changing the world to be ours You know I want you It's not a secret I try to hide But I can't have you We're bound to break and my hands are tied"

Dean Lewis,Be Alright,Pop,Pop,Pop,"I look up from the ground To see your sad and teary eyes You look away from me And I see there's something you're trying to hide And I reach for your hand but it's cold You pull away again And I wonder what's on your mind And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake You start to tremble and your voice begins to break You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's They were my mate's And I feel the color draining from my face And my friend said ""I know you love her, but it's over, mate It doesn't matter, put the phone away It's never easy to walk away, let her go It'll be alright"" So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head And everything deleted like the past, it was gone And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake And everything I know tells me that I should walk away But I just want to stay And my friend said ""I know you love her, but it's over, mate It doesn't matter, put the phone away It's never easy to walk away, let her go It'll be okay It's gonna hurt for a bit of time So bottoms up, let's forget tonight You'll find another and you'll be just fine Let her go"" But nothing heals the past like time And they can't steal The love you're born to find But nothing heals the past like time And they can't steal The love you're born to find ""I know you love her, but it's over, mate It doesn't matter, put the phone away It's never easy to walk away, let her go It'll be okay It's gonna hurt for a bit of time So bottoms up, let's forget tonight You'll find another and you'll be just fine Let her go"" It'll be alright It'll be alright It'll be alright It'll be alright It'll be alright"
